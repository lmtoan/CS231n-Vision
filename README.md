- Q2: Training a Support Vector Machine (svm_Toan.py)
- Q3: Implement a Softmax classifier (softmax_Toan.py)
- Q4: Two-Layer Neural Network (two_layer_net.py)
- Q5: Higher Level Representations: Image Features (features_Toan.py)

Assignment 2 (Implemented on Google Cloud. Completed in April 2017):
- Q1: Fully-connected Neural Network (FullyConnectedNets_Toan.ipynb)
- Q2: Batch Normalization (BatchNormalization_Toan.ipynb)
- Q3: Dropout (Dropout_Toan.ipynb)
- Q4: Convolutional Networks (ConvolutionalNetworks_Toan.ipynb)
- Q5: TensorFlow on CIFAR-10 (Tensorflow_Toan.py). Best performance using a simplified ResNet: **Accuracy of 78.2%**

Assignment 3 (Implemented on med2lab.com GPU server. In progress as of May 2017):
- Q1: Image Captioning with Vanilla RNNs on MS-COCO data (RNN_Captioning_Toan.ipynb)
- Q2: Image Captioning with Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) RNNs on MS-COCO data (LSTM_Captioning_Toan.ipynb)
- Q3: Network Visualization: Saliency maps, Class Visualization, and Fooling Images. *Introduce the pretrained SqueezeNet model, compute gradients with respect to images, and use them to produce saliency maps and fooling images* (In progress)
- Q4: Style Transfer. *Learn how to create images with the content of one image but the style of another* (In progress)
- Q5: Generative Adversarial Networks. *Learn how to generate images that match a training dataset, and use these models to improve classifier performance when training on a large amount of unlabeled data and a small amount of labeled data* (In progress)
